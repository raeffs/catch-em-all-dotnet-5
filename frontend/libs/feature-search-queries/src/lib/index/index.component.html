    <p><b>Collect & Minimize Expenses</b></p>
    <p>
      You can start by searching for some precious treasures that you would like to collect. Maybe you want to start a
      new collection? Or you already collected a ton of stuff, but there is this one piece that's still missing? The app
      will crawl through the depths of the internet and notify you once it found it.
    </p>
    <p><b>Sell & Maximize Profit</b></p>
    <p>
      You don't care about collecting things? Maybe you have something laying around that you'd like to sell, but you
      don't know at which price? In that case the app can keep track of others that try to sell the same stuff as you
      and tell you at which price someone actually bought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you're not sure what you're looking for; don't worry. Just give it a try! You can adjust everything later
      or start over from scratch if you don't like the result.
